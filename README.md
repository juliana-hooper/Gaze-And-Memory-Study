# Gaze Reinstatement and Episodic Memory Study

## Description
This project investigates the interaction between gaze reinstatement and episodic memory retrieval. The study explores how gaze behavior during scene encoding influences memory recall accuracy and spatial memory under different cognitive demands. The study uses eye-tracking technology to measure participants' gaze patterns and their subsequent memory performance.

## Research Focus
- **Gaze Reinstatement**: Examining how the eye movements during the encoding phase influence memory retrieval.
- **Episodic Memory Retrieval**: Investigating how participants recall visual scenes from memory.
- **Eye-Tracking Technology**: Utilizing Tobii Pro eye trackers to record gaze patterns during encoding and recall.

## Methods
Participants were shown various scenes during the encoding phase, after which they were asked to recall specific locations from those scenes. Eye movements were recorded using Tobii Pro eye trackers, and the accuracy of memory recall was measured under different cognitive interference conditions.

### Key Procedures:
1. **Scene Encoding**: Participants viewed a series of naturalistic scenes.
2. **Memory Retrieval Task**: Participants were asked to recall specific spatial locations from the scenes.
3. **Gaze Measurement**: Gaze patterns during both encoding and recall were captured and analyzed.

## Setup/Installation
To run this project, ensure that the following tools are installed:
- Python (version 3.x)
- PsychoPy for experiment design
- Tobii Pro SDK or Pro Spectrum software for eye-tracking integration

### Dependencies:
```bash
pip install psychopy
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
